#' Extend a bag of cells in one direction, optionally up to a boundary
#' condition.
#'
#' @description A bag of data cells is a data frame with at least the
#' columns 'row' and 'col', as well as any others that carry information about
#' the cells, e.g. their values.  More cells may be added to the bag by
#' extending the bag in a given direction.  Unless a boundary condition is
#' specified, all cells up to the edge of the sheet will be added.
#' @param bag Data frame. The original selection, including at least the columns
#' 'row' and 'column', which are numeric/integer vectors.
#' @param cells Data frame. All the cells in the sheet, within which to extend
#' the bag. Including at least the columns 'row' and 'column', as well as any
#' columns referred to by the bounadry formula.
#' @param direction Character vector length 1. The direction in which to extend,
#' among the compass directions "N", "E", "S", "W", where "N" is north (up).
#' @param boundary Formula to express a boundary condition. Defaults to
#' `FALSE`, which means the extension will go to the boundary of the sheet. `~
#' col <= 50` would up to the 50th column, but see 'details' for how this might
#' behave unpredictably depending on 'include'.
#' @param include Logical vector length 1. Whether to include in the extension
#' the first cell at which the boundary condition is met.  Can be unpredictable
#' when `TRUE` if `boundary` is something like `~ col <= 50`, because if there
#' is no cell in the 50th column, then the first cell beyond the 50th column
#' will be included.
#' @details A bag may have ragged rows or ragged cols. Gaps will not be filled
#' in, and the edge that is extended will be justified up to the first
#' row/column in which the boundary condition is met.
